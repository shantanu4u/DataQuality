Here's a refined and professional version of your sentence:

I am rating myself high in bringing business impact to the organization, primarily due to the successful execution of the X API integration project, which has delivered significant value during the customer creation process in Y. Previously, this process was largely manualâ€”customer details such as name and address were typically entered by referencing physical materials like visiting cards. Although we had access to an address search system via Z API, the results were often inaccurate, leading to frequent mismatches and inconsistencies.

As a result, most users opted for manual data entry, which introduced a high volume of data quality issues, requiring repeated corrections and consuming valuable time. We explored various vendor solutions to address this, but most were either too costly or failed to deliver the required accuracy and efficiency.

After thorough investigation, I identified that X API could serve as a highly accurate and cost-effective alternative. By integrating X API, we enabled a system where users could search and select validated address information directly, eliminating the need for manual entry. This not only simplified the user experience but also significantly improved the accuracy of the data being captured.

As a result, address-related errors dropped by nearly 80%, greatly enhancing the data quality and operational efficiency of the customer creation process. The solution reduced manual effort, improved turnaround time, and brought lasting impact across multiple teams that rely on clean and consistent customer data.
