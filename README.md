Here’s a refined and more professional version of your sentence:


---

"The X project required close collaboration with stakeholders from all SAP systems connected to the Y platform, as customer creation is initiated in the Z system and subsequently synchronized across the SAP landscape. The objective was to enforce Z as the single source of customer creation, eliminating the possibility of customer records being created directly in SAP going forward.

To achieve this, it was essential to ensure that every customer creation process in Z was fully implemented and operational. This involved a deep understanding of the business processes within each SAP system, engaging with their respective stakeholders, and aligning them to adopt the new approach—where all customer data originates in Z before being propagated to SAP systems."
