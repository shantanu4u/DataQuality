I am rating myself high in bringing business impact to the organization, primarily due to the successful execution of the X API integration project, which has delivered significant value during the customer creation process in Y. Previously, this process was largely manual—customer details such as name and address were typically entered by referencing physical materials like visiting cards. Although we had access to an address search system via Z API, the results were often inaccurate, leading to frequent mismatches and inconsistencies.

As a result, most users opted for manual data entry, which introduced a high volume of data quality issues, requiring repeated corrections and consuming valuable time. We explored various vendor solutions to address this, but most were either too costly or failed to deliver the required accuracy and efficiency.

After thorough investigation, I identified that X API could serve as a highly accurate and cost-effective alternative. By integrating X API, we enabled a system where users could search and select validated address information directly, eliminating the need for manual entry. This not only simplified the user experience but also significantly improved the accuracy of the data being captured.

As a result, address-related errors dropped by nearly 80%, greatly enhancing the data quality and operational efficiency of the customer creation process. The solution reduced manual effort, improved turnaround time, and brought lasting impact across multiple teams that rely on clean and consistent customer data.

Here's a refined and professionally polished version of your paragraph:

The X project was a critical initiative for our team, as it laid the foundation for Y's future development landscape, particularly for the upcoming Z project. The core objective was to establish Salesforce as the single source of truth for all customer data creation—ensuring that no data modifications would occur directly in SAP or any other connected systems within Y's ecosystem.

Achieving this required an in-depth study of all integration points, including Kafka, Salesforce connectors, SAP interfaces, and other non-SAP systems. The successful execution of the X project was essential, as it served as the first step toward enforcing the new architecture where all customer creation must occur exclusively through Salesforce.

One of the key challenges was that several scenarios still allowed customer data to be created directly within SAP or other systems, bypassing the intended process. To address this, we identified and integrated all such scenarios into the X project’s scope. This involved extensive coordination with customer teams, delivering knowledge transfer (KT) sessions, and conducting end-to-end testing across systems to ensure consistency and synchronization.

Ensuring real-time system sync and data consistency was particularly challenging, as it required cross-functional understanding and collaboration across multiple platforms and technologies. This phase demanded deep cross-system analysis and seamless orchestration between teams, making it one of the most complex yet impactful parts of the project.

The project to fetch the last transaction date from the SAP system into the MDM platform posed a significant challenge. We needed to query the SAP system to identify which data had the most recent transaction. If a newer transaction date existed, we had to use an intermediary platform to filter and push the relevant data into the MDM system.

This information was essential for the Salesforce system, as it needed to calculate which data records were active or inactive within the company based on recent transactions.

During this project, I learned X, Y, and Z, which enabled me to design a solution that not only allowed MDM to accurately capture the latest transaction dates but also ensured the seamless transfer of this information to Salesforce. This approach also provided better visibility into which T systems are currently conducting business with the company.
