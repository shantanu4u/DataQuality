Here's a refined, professional, and more structured version of your sentence with improved clarity, grammar, and flow:

"At the core of the Y platform lies the Master Data Management (MDM) solution, which is responsible for managing customer data. Surrounding the MDM are multiple interconnected systems that support the customer data lifecycle—from the initial creation interface, through middleware responsible for data streaming, to the synchronization of customer records across various downstream systems.

To ensure traceability and operational transparency, all activities across these stages are logged in the ElasticStack system. These logs play a critical role in identifying issues such as data flow disruptions, inconsistencies, or missing information across the platform. However, one major gap remained: the SAP systems.

Unlike other components, SAP logs were not readily accessible because the SAP interfaces are complex and not directly exposed to non-SAP platforms. While there were solutions available—such as using RPA bots to log into SAP systems and extract interface logs—these approaches were costly and added unnecessary complexity.

I sought a more cost-effective, sustainable solution using existing components in our landscape. During my analysis, I identified that SAP Solution Manager (SolMan) was already integrated with all SAP systems. By simply enabling SolMan’s built-in monitoring and alerting infrastructure (specifically its Interface and Connection Monitoring and System Log Analysis tools), we could extract relevant SAP logs without additional licensing or automation tools.

With this enhancement, we successfully integrated SAP logs into the ElasticStack ecosystem, closing the visibility gap and enabling end-to-end monitoring of customer data flow across the entire Y platform. This not only improved root-cause analysis capabilities but also ensured a more unified and cost-efficient observability framework."
