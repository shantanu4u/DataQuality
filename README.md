"The Y platform initially had a Non-Regression Testing (NRT) framework built using TestNG. While the framework served its purpose, it posed several operational challenges over time. It lacked speed and scalability, and even minor changes in test scenarios demanded regular intervention from Java developers, since the entire suite was tightly coupled with Java code. This made the process of maintaining and updating tests both time-consuming and resource-intensive.

Given that the Y platform is primarily API-driven, I identified an opportunity to modernize the testing strategy by leveraging Postman Enterprise Edition, specifically using the Postman CLI in combination with GitHub Actions for continuous integration and test automation. This shift offered a low-code and more maintainable alternative to the existing Java/TestNG setup.

With the new solution in place, we achieved several key improvements:

Faster test execution, thanks to Postman's optimized request engine.

Simplified maintenance, as test cases could now be easily created and modified by non-developers.

Greater agility, since changes in test logic no longer required full code deployment cycles.

Tight integration with GitHub Actions enabled seamless automation and CI/CD compatibility.


As a result, the new framework not only enhanced the speed and reliability of our NRT processes but also significantly reduced manual intervention and technical debt. This modernization was recognized and appreciated across multiple teams within the organization.

The success of our approach led to increased interest from other groups, including the Z team, who were facing similar bottlenecks with their own TestNG-based test setup. Impressed by the efficiency gains we achieved, they expressed interest in adopting our solution architecture for their platform as well. This initiative not only demonstrated the technical maturity of the Y platform but also established a reusable pattern for scalable, low-maintenance testing across the organization."
